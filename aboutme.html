            I'm from Hyderabad, India. I'm currently doing my Bachelor of science in Management Information Systems at Northwest Missouri State University. I'll be graduating in May 2022 and also I am planning on doing my Master's in Global Management starting from Fall 2022 from Thunderbird Business School in Pheonix, Arizona. I like to travel and explore new places, I have so far been to 5 countries and upto 12 states in USA.

        <h2>Parasite</h2>

            I like the movie's genre and how it's been shown to the audience. The suspense and also the fact knowing how it is living in a different country and experiencing things that a normal people would experience is very interesting to watch. Not a single movie scene was disappointing and it also an Oscar winning Film.
